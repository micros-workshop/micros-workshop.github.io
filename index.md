### Overview

The _Mixed-Initiative ConveRsatiOnal Systems workshop (MICROS)_ aims at bringing novel ideas and investigating new solutions on conversational assistant systems. The increasing popularity of personal assistant systems, as well as smartphones, has changed the way users access online information, posing new challenges for information seeking and filtering. MICROS will have a particular focus on mixed-initiative conversational systems, namely, systems that can provide answers in a proactive way (e.g., asking for clarification or proposing possible interpretations for ambiguous and vague requests). We will invite people working on conversational systems or interested in the workshop topics to send us their position and research manuscripts.

<!--The increasing popularity of personal assistant systems and smartphones has drawn attention to conversational systems. Thanks to the recent advances in automatic speech recognition and voice generation, conversational systems are largely employed in smart-home devices (e.g., Google Home, Amazon Alexa) as well as wearable devices (e.g., Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant). 

The 2nd Edition of the Workshop on _Mixed-Initiative ConveRsatiOnal Systems_ (MICROS@CIKM2022) aims at investigating and collecting novel ideas and contributions in the field of conversational systems. These systems provide a conversational interface for different tasks ranging from seeking information to performing e-commerce transactions. 

MICROS aims to bring together researchers from academia and industry to discuss the challenges and future of conversational systems. The workshop will have a particular focus on mixed-initiative conversational systems. These proactive systems do not simply provide answers but also propose possible interpretations for ambiguous and vague requests, improving the user's information-seeking experience.

We invite people working on conversational search as well as interactive recommendation to send us their position and research papers. Novel approaches for conversational information seeking that are based on natural language processing and artificial intelligence are also welcome. We encourage submissions on  approaches for conversational search, recommendation, evaluation techniques, data creation and curation, as well as domain-specific applications for conversational systems. The workshop will prioritize innovative and impactful contributions, all the accepted papers will be presented as contribution talks and will have the opportunity to be published in the CEUR proceedings. 
The workshop will also have keynote talks by experienced researchers and a panel discussion to share insights about conversational systems.  -->

### Submissions

Papers must be submitted by **(extended deadline) September 4, 2022 (23:59 AoE)** via EasyChair ([Submission Link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=micros2022)).

Submitted papers should be in the ACM two-column conference format. The workshop has a **single-blind** reviewing process, so the submissions can include the name and affiliations of authors.
 

The following paper categories are welcome:
- research papers on novel, original, and unpublished work (pre-prints submitted to ArXiv are eligible). **Max length: 10 pages, plus references**
- extended abstracts summarizing published results or ongoing works/ideas. **Max length: 3 pages, plus references**

All accepted papers will be presented at the workshop. 

### Topics
The workshop topics include but are not limited to:

- Applications of conversational search and recommendation systems
    - Large-scale retrieval candidate responses (e.g., documents, passages) in conversational search
    - Conversational and question-based recommendation systems
    - Tracking information-need evolution during the conversation (e.g., context changes)
    - Processing and rewriting of natural language conversational queries
    - Relevance feedback in conversational search
- Mixed-initiative interaction systems, such as clarification and preference elicitation in conversational systems
     - Dialogue schema for conversational search
    - Conversational navigation of search results
    - Conversation history understanding and query modeling
    - Pro-active search and recommendation interactions in conversational search
- Deep learning and reinforcement learning for conversational search
    - Conversational question answering
    - Result summarization, explanation, and presentation in conversational search
    - Balance and bias for more inclusive conversational systems
- Multi-modal interactions for conversational interfaces (e.g., speech-only and small-screen interfaces)
    - Voice-based search engine operations
    - User intent and dialog state tracking in conversational search
    - Personalization and user models for conversational search
- Specialized applications and use  cases for conversational search (e.g., health, finance, travel)
